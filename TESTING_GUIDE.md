# Portfolio Testing Guide

## Changes Made to Fix Issues

### 1. JavaScript Animation Fix

- **File**: `wwwroot/portfolio.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added interval management to prevent duplicate timers
  - Increased delay from 100ms to 200ms for better DOM readiness
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Added null checks to prevent errors

### 2. Navigation Fix

- **File**: `Components/Pages/Home.razor`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `StateHasChanged()` to force UI updates
  - Added re-initialization of JavaScript when returning to home section
  - Added `type="button"` to the CTA button for proper Blazor handling
  - Enhanced the `ShowSection` method to properly handle state changes

### 3. Component Structure

- **ProjectsSection.razor**: Standalone component for projects
- **ContactSection.razor**: Standalone component for contact info
- Both components are properly imported via `_Imports.razor`

## How to Test

### Step 1: Run the Application

```cmd
cd C:\Users\deanm\source\repos\DeveloperPortfolioDashboard\PortfolioClient
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Open Browser

Navigate to: `http://localhost:5129`

### Step 3: Test Navigation

1. **Click "Projects" in navbar** - Should show projects section
2. **Click "Contact" in navbar** - Should show contact section with your picture
3. **Click "Home" in navbar** - Should return to home section
4. **Click "DM" logo** - Should also return to home

### Step 4: Test CTA Button

1. From home section, click **"View my projects"** button
2. Should navigate to Projects section
3. Should scroll to top

### Step 5: Test JavaScript Animation

1. On home section, watch the text after "I build compelling "
2. Should rotate every 3 seconds:
   - digital experiences
   - web applications
   - user interfaces
   - scalable solutions

### Step 6: Browser Console Check

Press F12 to open Developer Tools, go to Console tab:

- Should see: "Animated text element found, starting rotation..."
- If you see "Animated text element not found", there's a DOM timing issue

## Troubleshooting

### If animation doesn't work:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify `portfolio.js` is loaded (Network tab)
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5)

### If navigation doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the sections are rendering (inspect element)
3. Make sure you're clicking, not hovering

### If components don't show:

1. Verify files exist:
   - `Components/ProjectsSection.razor`
   - `Components/ContactSection.razor`
2. Check `_Imports.razor` has `@using PortfolioClient.Components`
3. Rebuild: `dotnet build`

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Navigation**: All nav links should change sections instantly
✅ **CTA Button**: "View my projects" should show projects section
✅ **Animation**: Text should rotate smoothly every 3 seconds
✅ **Scroll**: Switching to Projects/Contact should scroll to top
✅ **Active State**: Current section should be highlighted in navbar

## Files Modified

1. `Components/Pages/Home.razor` - Main page with navigation logic
2. `wwwroot/portfolio.js` - JavaScript for text animation
3. `Components/ProjectsSection.razor` - Projects component
4. `Components/ContactSection.razor` - Contact component

All changes are backward compatible and don't break existing functionality.
